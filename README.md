# PokemonJS

A Pok√©mon fan-art game made using vanilla Javascript (no libs/framework only HTML5-Canvas) when I was student (2015).

Disclaimer:
- I only produced the source code, I picked images online and modify it when needed, they are not my property.  

- I won't accept pull requests concerning the codebase, but I'll carefully read your advices or features requests.  
Also, feel free to help me with your art, as long as it's yours and I like your artistic-style (I won't be that harsh though).

- I'm building this project for my own fun, I will never challenge or discredit Nintendo work, I'm a really big fan of their game.  

- If ever someone from Nintendo is watching this project, please, don't get me into troubles, hire me instead ! ;)

## WIP
After many years, I'm currently adding more love to this project.  

The goal of the current iteration is:  
- modern JS / devtools  
- restore save function via local webstorage  
- <del>multi-dialog discussions</del> / better UI design  
- animations  
- better game-designer tools (to produce content)
- reshape and upgrade of the game engine (event & rendering & colisions) system
