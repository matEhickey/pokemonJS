# PokemonJS

** Demo [here](https://matehickey.github.io/pokemonJS/)**

A fan-art made using vanilla Javascript (no libs only HTML5-Canvas) when I was student (2015).

I removed the save function (PHP) to make it runnable without server, maybe I could implement it again with browser-storage or cookies..

I only produce the source code, I picked images online, they are not my property
